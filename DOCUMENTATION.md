# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

_This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!_

## Approach

The key objective here is to display the data in a "user friendly" way, which means that my focus of developing the whole application will be to make it as user friendly as possible.

1. FIrst things first, test the data recieved from the backend, I used Postman for this, this way I had an idea of what data I needed to render/use; i cannot design a frontend without knowing whar data needs to be shown.
2. Step two, from the data listed, now design the frontend on Figma, however I would look at existing solutions and inspiration first on pinterest and dribbble to get an idea from people who are better than me.
3. Translate the figma design into React TSX code.
4. Create forms and funcitonality to send data to the backend.
5. Handle missing data in a user friendly way.

Going to be working in a professional manner using pull requests, and git industry standard protocols.
